<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <em className="ph i">Folklore</em> is made of two words:<em className="ph i">folk</em>, which means<em className="ph i"> regional people</em>, and <em className="ph i">lore</em>, which means<em className="ph i">stories</em>. Therefore,<em className="ph i">folklore </em>reflects stories told by people in a particular region. Folklore can define a population's values, beliefs, and preferred way of life with its literary themes.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Folklore was passed down from earlier generations, who told the stories verbally. Each generation would then tell their own children, and these stories became part of a culture's tradition. The invention of the printing press allowed these stories to be published â€“ and shared with the world.</p>
